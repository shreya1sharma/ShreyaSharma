This post is about my experience at Neural Pocket, an AI start-up based in Tokyo. I got an opportunity to learn about its technologies and interact with its executive members at an event called Open House. Here are my notes from the event.

Neural Pocket is an AI start-up in fashion industry based in Tokyo and gradually moving towards smart city, mobility and manufacturing.

### Technologies

**1. Fashion Trend Analysis**
A dashboard shows fashion analytics about which style is popular, which color is preferred, which combination of clothes are more likely to sell. Target customers are apparal industry and fashion industry (example Uniqlo). The technology helps them th understand their customer preferences and prevent wastage of resources in creating useless or low-profit clothes.

**2. Digital Marketing Display Screen**
A smart screen which displays target-focussed ads to increase revenue of the advertising industries. The 
screen is places outside stores or public areas to capture crowd attention. When a person sees at the screen, his/her age, gender, persona is estimated in real-time and an advertisment matching his/her personality and the one he/she might be interested in is displayed. The estimation process can also take other contextual factors into account like if two people are walking together then they may be a couple in which case the screen shows couple-centric ads. Target customers are adertising agencies who take subscription-like service to post ads and shop owners who buy the screen to understand their customer behavior. The screen also saves the purchasing history and behaviour of the customers in a database.
