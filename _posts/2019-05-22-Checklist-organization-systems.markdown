Oops, my mind is brimming to the top!

Often, we will overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things we have to organize each day. This is what I am going through recently. I have to manage so many things that I just can't keep track of!!!
So I have decided to do a mental dump. In this post, I am making a checklist of all my organizational systems so that I can easily manage my life! This checklist is very subjective but I encourage anyone to take ideas from my checklist if their mind is also overflowing.
