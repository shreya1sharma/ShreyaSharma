	- Understand the business need and present the data science solution to clients
	
2. Data Engineer/Data Management Professional/Hadoop
	- Hired by companies who start seeing a lot of traffic [and increasingly large amounts of data], and they need someone to set up a lot of data infrastructure. Heavy statistics and machine learning expertise is less important than strong software engineering skills.
	 
3. Machine Learning Engineer
	- Ideal for someone who has a formal mathematics, statistics or physics background and is hoping to continue down a more academic path. Companies that fall into this group could be consumer facing companies with massive amounts of data or companies that are offering data-based service.
	- Algorithms, predictive analytics and deep learning

4. Data Scientist
	- Perform analysis, touch production code, visualize data, etc.
