### Notes on CTO job role

* 4 must-have knowledge for a CTO:
  1. **T**eam Management
  2. **T**ools and techniques
  3. **T**echnology and trends
  4. **T**iming of decisions

* Jobs of a CTO:
  1. Strategy - meeting corporate goals with technology, bringing technology in different departments
  2. Translating - Communicate the business needs to tech guys and vice-versa in an effective way
  3. Leading - setting goals and plans for the engineering team, preventing others from distracting engineers
  4. HR - hiring the right people and mentoring your team to develop their skill set

* Different types of CTO:
  1. Start-up coder - only person, main tech guy
  2. Hands-on CTO - leading 4~5 people
  3. Mid-size - leading 50 people
  4. Corporate - leading >100 people

* Technology team consists of:
  1. Software development
  2. Quality assistance
  3. IT support
  4. Product management
  5. Project management
  6. Chief scientist
  7. Data science
  8. Technical writers
  9. Professional service

  - the first 3 are the most common in any company, the remaining are mostly in big corporations

* Common CTO failure modes
  1. Odd Man Out
  2. Kid CTO
  3. Six executives in search of a CTO

* Managing a project to avoid 'That's what I said but not what I meant'
  1. Accurate and non-ambiguous specifications
  2. Regular check-ins and course sorrection
  3. Agile software development

* Engineering project Triangle - used to define quality and analyze a project
  1. Scope - features, functionality, performance quality
  2. Cost - resources, budget
  3. Time - speed
  
  - any project should focus on one of the above
  - a projects constrained on all 3 dimensions often fail
  - don't build a cool interesting project that nobody wants. A technologist should understand business needs.
  - it is cheaper to make a change as early as possible. With passage of time, cost of change exponentially rises.
