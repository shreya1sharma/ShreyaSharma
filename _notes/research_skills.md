<summary> Reading a Research Paper</summary>
	
Disclaimer:This advice is based on my experience with machine learning and computer vision papers. These tips may not be applicable in other domains.  

Dual benefits: collection of ideas + improvement in your own tech writing

1. 3 pass approach (funnel structure)

	a. First pass ~ 20 mins : abstract, introduction and conclusion [select]
	b. Second pass  ~ 2 hrs : Method and experiments [understand]
	c. Third pass ~2-3 days : actually breakdown the maths and reimplement the paper in your mind and then through code [implement]
		Note:
· If the paper does not pass the first pass, don’t read it further. It does not interest you.
· If the paper implementation is not required immediately, do not conduct the third pass. 
· After second pass, draw a block diagram of the proposed method by hand . This ensures that you have completely understood the flow of the method and functions of each block.

2. 6Q’s to break down the structure

	a. Each paper is trying to sell an idea to solve a problem. You need to clearly identify both. How important/tough is the problem and how much effective is the solution?
	b. If a paper tries to sell two ideas, that’s a warning sign of a bad paper.
	c. Ask these 5 questions  to extract from paper [usually should be clear from introduction]
		i. What is the main research field and why it is important
		ii. What are the Common problems
		iii. How the Previous work has address these problems
		iv. What problem is yet unsolved by the previous work
		v. How is this paper tackling that problem?
		vi. What is the main contribution/novelty of the paper?
From Andrej karpathy’s blog:
		A good flow of ideas is then along the lines of 1) X (+define X if not obvious) is an important problem 2) The core challenges are this and that. 2) Previous work on X has addressed these with Y, but the problems with this are Z. 3) In this work we do W (?). 4) This has the following appealing properties and our experiments show this and that. You can play with this structure a bit but these core points should be clearly made.
		 
3. Active and critical reading

	a. Talk to your paper and question the arguments as you read
	b. Literally, mark the parts which does not fit your common sense
	
4. Circle the unknown terms

	a. While reading, there may be many terms or concepts that you are unfamiliar with. Circle all those. Google them after first reading. These are bridge to fill your knowledge gaps.
	b. Another recommendation is to circle the words which eased your understanding and made your reading smooth. This helps you to learn how to select words for concise, cohesive writing.
	c. If there are too many circles in the paper, it’s a warning sign that you are jumping into this paper too early. You must read some more basic paper first, and then shift to the advanced one
	
5. Mark all the important references
	a. You can refer them to find new papers for your literature survey. Literature survey is another skill which I will discuss about in another blog.
	b. Helps you to create a chain of thoughts and innovations.
	
6. Build upon it

	a. Your goal to read a paper is to get new ideas and further stimulate new ideas in your mind for your own problem. 
	b. So after reading the paper, you can do the following things:
		i. If you do not have a problem at hand, find the areas of improvement in the paper.  Which assumptions/limitations can you minimize? Which application you can make with this technique? What problems are yet to be solved?
		ii. If you have the problem at hand from a different domain, find how this technique can be used in your domain?
		iii. What’s the author perspective on future work?
		
7. Formats to save your knowledge

	After reading the paper you must create a system to save your knowledge because in this era of information overload, our memory is highly volatile. I suggest three tools:
	a. Spreadsheet – create columns
	b. Powerpoint – same points as in spreadsheet but you can save figure too and arrange papers logically
	c. Research journal – on-the-go paper reading
	 
That’s it folks. I hope my 7 tips will make your paper reading process more enjoyable and effective. Do let me know if you any great suggestion. Let’s grow collaboratively.

<summary> Survey in Research </summary>
  
	• Break survey into 2 parts - literature survey and market survey
		a. Literature survey - academic point of view
		b. Market survey - business point of view
	• Literature survey
		○ Clarify the topic- each word of the research theme
		○ Get the basics - tutorial papers/books/PPT
		○ State-of-the art - Specific papers (Highly cited >100, recent <5 years)
		○ Key research groups and academic leaders
		○ Main components of the block diagram
		○ Frequently used terms and notations
		○ Key problems and ideas. Logical connection between different ideas (how one paper solves the problem of previous paper)
		○ Research gap-  challenges yet to be solved
		○ Datasets
		○ Evaluation metrics
		○ Select baseline papers that can immediately be used
		○ Survey related domains and how they tackle with the challenges
		○ Summarize in a report/PPT/OneNote notes
	• Market survey
		○ Government reports, technical reviews, market research reports for social aspect
		○ Key companies
		○ Commercial products and their features/ what value do they provide to customer
		○ Customers and use-cases/ which area on the Globe
		○ Business model to sell the technology
		○ Limitations in current products
		○ Gap between academic and commercial research
		○ Identify the position of innovation
		○ Summarize in a report, make a table of products and their features, a graph to show innovation position
	• Select a problem for your research
		○ Theoretical research problem and how it can be transformed or utilized in commercial product/business
		○ Practical Business research problem and how the academic techniques can be used to solve it
