## Body language
* Eye contact and smile – one thought, one look
* Body posture and position of hands – move to a position, say  a message, then move. Don’t just ramble here
* Pause at key points, eemphasize and nod

## Dealing with anxiety
* You are not looking nervous as much as you feel
* You can give a great presenation even when you are nervous. Noone whould know
* Practise like crazy. Rehearse weak parts over an over. 95% faults are removed during practiise
* Visualize yourself as giving a great presenation, especially the first few minutes
* If you are nervous, you are excited

## While making presenation
* Know your content very well
* Know your audience and your space- do they have screen, pointer, mice
* Focus on your message, not on yourself – your purpose is to educate the audience
* Never apologize, nobody knows what you forget except you. So keep going!
