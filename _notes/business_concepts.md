### Product-driven v/s Market-driven business

> “Don’t find customers for your products, find products for your customers.”  ~ Seth Godin

OR

> “It’s not the customer’s job to know what they want.” ~ Steve Jobs

Within a product-driven business, the development of the product originates from the internal visions of the company. Whereas, with a customer-driven business the development of the product and product direction originates from outside of the business.

Product-driven businesses do not assume there are any customers for their product. They identify people they think would be interested in the product and will invest in marketing and strategies to attract said people, with a view to turn them into customers through advertising the product and its benefits. It’s important to note, these customers do not have predictable behavioural patterns, it’s up to the business and its marketing strategies to influence behaviours to generate interest and most importantly sales for the business.

Conversely, customer-driven businesses assume that customers for their product already exist, and that their product will fix a behavioural pattern. The needs of the customer do not change, the business needs to identify what the needs and requirements are and then create a product to cater to or better serve those needs, than what’s already out there in the marketplace.

Key-points for product-driven
* Uniqueness
* Positioning in market
* Use of mass marketing

Key-points for market-driven
* Time relevance - first and fast
* Flexible convenience and customization for customer
* Value addition to customer
* Process - product quality + customer service

##### Which Approach Works Best?

It depends on the circumstances. Market driven companies usually benefit from consistent growth and strong customer/partner relationships. A product-driven approach is a short-term strategy that can move a company forward in big steps, but that successful product-driven companies must eventually transition to market-driven companies for long-term survival.
