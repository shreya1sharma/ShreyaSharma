[Quality over quantity: building the perfect data science project](https://towardsdatascience.com/quality-over-quantity-building-the-perfect-data-science-project-993ccc0b1241)

1. build your original project
2. your project should demonstrate as many skills as possible. Do not use just sklearn and pandas and do not show projects with titanic or mnist dataset. they do harm to your resume. everybody is using them. Use Web-scraping

3. do good exploratory data analysis.  an ideal project is one that demonstrates not only that you’re able to answer important data science questions, but that you’re capable of asking them, too very often, you’ll have a bunch of (dirty) data, and you’ll need to figure out what to do with it to generate value for your company.
4.  make  plots that are easy to show off to interviewers and recruiters before and during your interviews.
5. create a web app (using Flask, or some other Python-based web dev framework). Ideally, you should be able to approach someone at a Meetup or during an interview, and have them try out a few input parameters, or play with a few knobs, and have some (ideally visually appealing) result returned to them.
6. To make your project pitch compelling, make sure you have a story to tell about what you’ve built. Ideally, that story should include one or two unexpected insights you gained during your data exploration or model evaluation phase (e.g. “it turns out this class is really hard to tell apart from this other class because [reasons]”).
This helps you out because it:
- Weaves a narrative around your project that’s easier (and more interesting) for interviewers to remember; and
- Makes it clear that you’re someone who makes a point of getting to the bottom of your data science problems.

[Interview with Data Scientist at kaggle: Dr. Rachael Tatman](https://hackernoon.com/interview-with-data-scientist-at-kaggle-dr-rachael-tatman-8bc61f9efdb9)
1. Work on self projects, and not just Kaggle- this well help to self- learn data cleaning, annotation, design performance metric and what is the business value of your model
2. Know the why behind things, don't just say X doesnt work so I tried Y, know why X doesn't work and why Y works
3. Practise technical speaking more often at local meetups and conferences
4. Don't need a PhD to become a data scientist
5. Celebrate failure! it means you are growing and getting closer to what will work
6. Nobody knows everything and there is no ML expert. don't be afraid to accept that you don't know and then learn from it. But remember, you already have so kuch knowledge and you are bringing all your life experiences to learning
7. Read textbooks and do courses
8. Follow Twitter to stay updated
9. ML is just a tool but an overhyped tool, don't overrely on it and assume that it works under all situations and is always correct
