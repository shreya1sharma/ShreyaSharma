I'm Shreya Sharma, a data science researcher from India and currently based in Japan.

I completed my post-graduation in Geoinformatics and Remote Sensing from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), and under-graduation in Electrical Engineering from [Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology Pantnagar](https://www.linkedin.com/school/collegeoftechnologyg.b.p.u.a.t.pantnagar/about/).

Currently, I am working at Data Science Research Laboratories, [NEC Corporation Japan](https://www.nec.com/en/global/rd/index.html), where my research work lies at the intersection of machine learning and geospatial analytics.
We develop machine learning algorithms to process massive satellite images of Earth and discover useful insights.


Over the years, I have developed interests in physics, probability, statistics, image processing, machine learning, electrical networks and deep learning. I enjoy learning new technologies and aspire to become a great coder.

When not making travel itineraries or cracking jokes at dead serious situations, I love getting involved in three types of activities - reading, creating and sharing.
And that's the inspiration behind this website! Through this website, my aim is to share what I read and create on a day-to-day basis.

If you have any question or want to reach out, feel free to shoot me an email or connect via LinkedIn. Iâ€™m always open to meeting interesting people.

Thank you for visiting my website!
